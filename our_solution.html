                Green houses are traditionally built on large surfaces, over one plan. 
                What if we started building upwards, rather than exploting unnecessary large surfaces?

                GreenSky is a UN-funded organization, building green houses in big cities across Europe.
                The skyscrapers are producing healthy food for the cities population, in a sustainable manner.
                The result of having green houses built in the cities, are local food, less carbon emissions and a more self reliant city.
